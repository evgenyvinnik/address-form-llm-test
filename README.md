**Prompt**
```
Implement React component for US Address input.
I want to use MUI component library for this.
Make sure it has the following lines:
Address line 1
Address line 2 (marked as optional)
City
State (in the form of a combobox)
Zipcode

It should have one single Submit button and a callback function that would return json object with the address data to the parent component

Make sure component is easy to reuse in our existing code, and it is fully accessible and it is possible to navigate it using keyboard 

Provide clear details for deployment and testing
```

Basically I have asked a bunch of LLMs to generate me the same component.
